 * UPA (Unstructured Persistence API)
 * Yet another ORM Framework
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Unstructured Persistence API, referred to as UPA, is a genuine effort
 * to raise programming language frameworks managing relational data in
 * applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform,
 * Enterprise Edition and Dot Net Framework equally to the next level of
 * handling ORM for mutable data structures. UPA is intended to provide
 * a solid reflection mechanisms to the mapped data structures while
 * affording to make changes at runtime of those data structures.
 * Besides, UPA has learned considerably of the leading ORM
 * (JPA, Hibernate/NHibernate, MyBatis and Entity Framework to name a few)
 * failures to satisfy very common even known to be trivial requirement in
 * enterprise applications.
