 * UPA (Unstructured Persistence API)
 *    Yet another ORM Framework
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Unstructured Persistence API, referred to as UPA, is a genuine effort 
 * to raise programming language frameworks managing relational data in 
 * applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, 
 * Enterprise Edition and Dot Net Framework equally to the next level of 
 * handling ORM for mutable data structures. UPA is intended to provide 
 * a solid reflection mechanisms to the mapped data structures while 
 * affording to make changes at runtime of those data structures. 
 * Besides, UPA has learned considerably of the leading ORM 
 * (JPA, Hibernate/NHibernate, MyBatis and Entity Framework to name a few) 
 * failures to satisfy very common even known to be trivial requirement in 
 * enterprise applications.
