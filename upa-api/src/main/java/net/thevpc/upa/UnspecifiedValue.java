 * UPA (Unstructured Persistence API)
 * Yet another ORM Framework
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Unstructured Persistence API, referred to as UPA, is a genuine effort
 * to raise programming language frameworks managing relational data in
 * applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform,
 * Enterprise Edition and Dot Net Framework equally to the next level of
 * handling ORM for mutable data structures. UPA is intended to provide
 * a solid reflection mechanisms to the mapped data structures while
 * affording to make changes at runtime of those data structures.
 * Besides, UPA has learned considerably of the leading ORM
 * (JPA, Hibernate/NHibernate, MyBatis and Entity Framework to name a few)
 * failures to satisfy very common even known to be trivial requirement in
 * enterprise applications.

/**
 * UnspecifiedValue is used to identify the "unspecified value" of fields of an entity
 * when dealing with unstructured Documents or Prototype Documents (Find by example).
 * Each field has has a unique value that is defined as "unspecified value",
 * if the field value is equal to that value, the field is supposed not to be explicitly
 * mentioned by user so that in "query by example" object for instance, that value is not
 * used in the where clause, and in update, that field is not updated either.
 * "Unspecified Value" is modified using "Field.setUnspecifiedValue".
 * If the value passed to that method corresponds to UnspecifiedValue.DEFAULT (which is the
 * default by the way), the unspecified value is the field's default type value ie
 * <code>null</code> for references, <code>0 (zero)</code> for numbers and <code>false</code>
 * for boolean.
 * <pre>
 *     PersistenceUnit s=UPAContext.getPersistenceUnit();
 *     //if the id field is numeric, zero is considered as the default value
 *     s.getEntity(Client.class).getField("id").setUnspecifiedValue(UnspecifiedValue.DEFAULT);
 *     //We suppose that Client has 2 attributes id of type int with default value 0
 *     //and name of type String and with default value null
 *     Client c=new Client();
 *     c.setName("Hammadi");
 *
 *     //this will list all Client name="Hammadi"
 *     //even though id=0, that value will not be used in where clause
 *     List&lt;Client> found=s.find(new QueryBuilder().byPrototype(c)).getEntityList();
 *
 *
 *     //if the id field is numeric, zero is considered as the default value
 *     s.getEntity(Client.class).getField("id").setUnspecifiedValue(-1);
 *
 *     //this will list all Client having id=0 and name="Hammadi"
 *     List&lt;Client> found2=s.find(new QueryBuilder().byPrototype(c)).getEntityList();
